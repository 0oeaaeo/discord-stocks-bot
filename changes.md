# 🚀 Discord Stock Exchange - New Features & Updates

Welcome to the latest update for the DSX Bot! We've added several highly requested features to make trading more strategic and rewarding.

## 🛡️ Anti-Abuse Measures
### Short-Selling Lockup
To ensure a fair market and prevent "scalping" (rapid-fire trading), all **Short Positions** now have a **1-hour lockup period**.
- You cannot cover (close) a short position within the first hour of opening it.
- Use `$shorts` to see the remaining lockup time (indicated by a 🔒 icon).

## 🤖 Automated Trading
### Limit Orders
You can now set orders to execute automatically when a stock hits your target price!
- **`$limit buy @user <shares> <price>`**: Set a "Buy Low" order. The bot will buy shares for you as soon as the stock price drops to or below your target.
- **`$limit sell @user <shares> <price>`**: Set a "Sell High" order. The bot will sell your shares when the stock hits your target price.
- You will receive a Direct Message from the bot when your order is triggered and executed.

## 📰 Dynamic Market News
Individual stocks now react to user activity in real-time! 
- **Breaking News Alerts**: High engagement (reactions and replies) can trigger bullish news events like "Viral Success" or "Community Favorite."
- **Immediate Impact**: News events cause an **instant 5-10% price boost** to the relevant stock.
- Stay active to see your name in the headlines!

## 🏆 Achievement System
Your trading milestones are now recognized with the new **Achievements** system.
- **Trophy Cabinet**: Use **`$achievements`** to view your earned badges and medals.
- **Milestone Alerts**: Major achievements like hitting **$1,000,000 Net Worth** are announced server-wide!
